COVID RELIEVERS - DON''T LET THIS NATIONAL LOCK YOUR MENTAL BLOCK


It is a web app, which includes a game. 


The project connects people to their nearest online grocery and medical stores and helps to place orders for the essentials. The people can also explore their areas for the new grocery and medical stores through this and contact the respective shopkeepers. 


Another dimension the project attempts to cover is the mental health that is being affected during this isolation. It engages the people in a game, where the user has to kill Corona viruses and protect their virtual family members. 


relievedorder@gmail.com is the email-id through which we are contacting the users/customers and the shopkeepers/ retailers as well. The futuristic idea is to score the people on the basis of their accuracy with which they play the game. And the top-scorers will be benefitted with discounts and will be given priority in their next purchases.
